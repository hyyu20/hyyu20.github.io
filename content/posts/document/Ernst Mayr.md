## 原文

I was born in a little town in Southern Bavaria to town of Kempton on the 5th of July 1904, this means that I'm now more than 93 years old. My father was a judge, and it was customary at that time in Germany, he was shifted to another location, every six to eight years so that we moved from camp to Wilkesberg where I began my natural history studies and then to Munich and then when my father died at an age when I was only 13 years old, my mother moved us to Dresden, where she came from, which is it's actually in Central, Germany and I stayed there until I had to go with until I went to the University. Now my family is remarkably well described in a book by sociologist as the German mandarins on the points out, that there was a social slaughter in Germany and which everybody had to go to the humanistic gymnasium. And so did l, and so had my father and my grandfather, and I had nine years of Latin and seven years of Greek, and a great deal of history and other subjects like that. It was a very so education and people in that social stratum of the mandarins either went into the civil service or they became university teachers. Well, in my case, the family was mostly had a strong medical background. My father was a judge, but his younger brother was a doctor. His father was a doctor. His grandfather was a doctor. His great grandfather was a doctor and so it was taking for granted in the family. I would become a doctor even though I was a I was the second son and I was perfectly happy with that decision. I was interested in medicine and or into the early death of my father, I was interested in diagnosis because I felt maybe he could have been saved if his illness had been diagnosed much more recently much more quickly. And so I was all prepared to take on the medical curriculum.
